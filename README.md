# Update PR Branch Action

![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/adRise/update-pr-branch/actions/workflows/unit_test.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/adRise/update-pr-branch/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/adRise/update-pr-branch)

> Automatically update the PR branch

The job of the action is to help click "Update branch" button for you. Designed to work with the `auto-merge` and ["Require branches to be up to date before merging"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging) options. It will update the newest open PR that match the below conditions

- The PR has the `auto-merge` option enabled
- The PR has 2 approvals and no changes-requested review
- The PR has all checks passed
- The PR branch has no conflicts with the base branch
- The PR branch is behind the base branch

## When do you need this action

You may consider to use this action if you:

- Have enabled the `auto-merge` [feature](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/automatically-merging-a-pull-request) in your repo.
- Have checked the "Require branches to be up to date before merging" checkbox for protected branches. See more [Require status checks before merging](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging)

Because of #2, even you have enabled `auto-merge` for a PR, the PR won't be automatically merged if the PR branch is behind the base branch, for example someone else merges another PR before your PR passes all CI checks. See the screenshot as below.

## Inputs

### `token`

**Required**

The [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/).

Need to note, you can't use `GITHUB_TOKEN` because of [this limitation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token)

### `required_approval_count`

**Required**

Default: 2

The action will skip PRs that have less approvals than `required_approval_count`.

We could retrieve this value from the repo settings through an API call but that will incur one more request. GitHub has [rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#usage-limits) on API usage of GitHub actions.

> API requests - You can execute up to 1000 API requests in an hour across all actions within a repository. If exceeded, additional API calls will fail, which might cause jobs to fail.

## Example usage

```yml
name: PR update

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'master'
jobs:
  autoupdate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: 'master'
      - name: Automatically update PR
        uses: adRise/update-pr-branch@VERSION_YOU_WANT_TO_USE
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.ACTION_USER_TOKEN }}
          required_approval_count: 2
```

Replace the `VERSION_YOU_WANT_TO_USE` with the actual version you want to use, check the version format [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsuses)

## Development

```bash
yarn
# this compile index.js to dest/init.js for running
yarn build
```

Note: You need to run `yarn build` before commit the changes because when the action only use the compiled `dest/index.js`.
